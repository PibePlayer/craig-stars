# craig-stars
An eponymous clone of the 4X game Stars!

## TODO
There are loads of things to do, but this section is for tracking things I've implmented but not fully.

* Production doesn't allocate unspent resources to research
* Max Population on planets by race
* Orbital ring colors for enemy, mixed, and friendly orbiting fleets
* Research at max level just stops, should switch to lowest unless all are max
* No terraforming view on hab summary
* No cloak, jam, or initiative in ship aggregate
